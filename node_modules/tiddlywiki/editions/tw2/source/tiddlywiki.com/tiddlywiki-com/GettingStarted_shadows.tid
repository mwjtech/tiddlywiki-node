The GettingStarted shadow tiddler contains information about how to start using your TiddlyWiki.
You can change it to include anything you desire.

For example a lot of tiddlywiki authors use it to explain what their wiki is about. This is a particularly useful approach because by default the GettingStarted tiddler is in the [[DefaultTiddlers|DefaultTiddlers shadows]] tiddler, thus opens automatically upon loading of the page.

By default it is also part of the [[MainMenu|MainMenu shadows]] tiddler so is included on the left side of the menu bar above.
