Recent versions of Firefox and Chrome feature tighter default security settings that can interfere with the operation of TiddlyWiki. The main issue is new restrictions on the ability of TiddlyWiki running from a {{{file://}}} URI to access other servers.
!!!Known Problems with Upgrading TiddlyWiki
Versions of TiddlyWiki before and including 2.6.3 are known to have an issue with the upgrade function. To upgrade these versions you will need to download an empty latest version of TiddlyWiki and import your content into it using the [[import function|Import Tiddlers]] in the backstage.
!!!Known Problems with Importing in TiddlyWiki
* It is not possible to import from TiddlyWiki's on servers which are not [[CORS|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing]] enabled. Popular sites such as [[TiddlyTools|http://tiddlytools.com]] are currently not CORS enabled. Fortunately this is fixable - webmasters can enable their sites to be CORS enabled by following the instructions [[here|http://enable-cors.org]] and if a website is not CORS enabled you can e-mail the owner to tell them the problem.
* Some browsers will only allow you to import from other TiddlyWikis in the same directory as your TiddlyWiki. If you use Chrome you can enable this by modifying the Chrome shortcut to include the following parameter
{{{
--allow-file-access-from-files
}}}
* In Opera you can enable this by entering the following into your address bar and ticking the checkbox.
{{{
opera:config#UserPrefs|AllowFileXMLHttpRequest
}}}
* Note some browsers, do not support import / upgrade in any form.
