Sometimes text can inadvertently match TiddlyWiki formatting instructions - particularly program code, or text pasted from elsewhere. In these situations you can either use MonospacedText or you can accomplish the same thing without the monospaced effect like this:
{{{
This is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &copy; and this site is called <<tiddler SiteTitle>>
<nowiki>This is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &copy; and this site is called <<tiddler SiteTitle>></nowiki>
"""This is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &copy; and this site is called <<tiddler SiteTitle>>"""
}}}
Which displays as:
This is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &copy; and this site is called <<tiddler SiteTitle>>
<nowiki>This is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &copy; and this site is called <<tiddler SiteTitle>></nowiki>
"""This is AnotherLink, this is a copyright symbol &copy; and this site is called <<tiddler SiteTitle>>"""
