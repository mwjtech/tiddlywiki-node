MicroContent and MicroCopy being fashionable words for self-contained fragments of content that are smaller than an entire pages.

Usually MicroContent is presented through some kind of aggregation that reduces the perceptual shock and resource cost of context switching (eg the way that blogs aggregating several entries onto a page, or Flickr presents a bunch of photos in an album). TiddlyWiki aggregates MicroContent items called [[tiddlers|Tiddler]] into pages that are loaded in one gulp and progressively displayed as the user clicks hypertext links to read them.
