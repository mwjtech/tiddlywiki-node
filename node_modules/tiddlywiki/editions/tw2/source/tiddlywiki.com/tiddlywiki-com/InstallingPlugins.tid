[[Plugins]] are just tiddlers containing ~JavaScript code that is tagged with <<tag systemConfig>>. TiddlyWiki executes any [[Plugins]] as it loads; they can add [[Macros]] or otherwise extend and enhance the base code.

The recommended way to install a plugin into your own copy of TiddlyWiki is to use ImportTiddlers (there are instructions for ManuallyInstallIngPlugins when required).
