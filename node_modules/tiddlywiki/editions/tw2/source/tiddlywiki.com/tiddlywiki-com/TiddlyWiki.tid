~TiddlyWiki is a complete [[wiki|WikiWikiWeb]] in a single HTML file. It contains the entire text of the wiki, and all the ~JavaScript, CSS and HTML goodness to be able to display it, and let you edit it or search it - without needing a server. Although, having said that, there are some fine ServerSide adaptations out there.

~TiddlyWiki was originally created by JeremyRuston and is now a thriving [[open source|OpenSourceLicense]] project with a busy [[Community]] of independent developers. [[Osmosoft]], part of [[BT|http://btplc.com]], is the leading contributor to the project.
