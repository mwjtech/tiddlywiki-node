A row of ToolbarButtons appears to the right of a tiddler title when the mouse is hovered over it. The buttons are:
* ''close'' - close the current tiddler
* ''edit'' - edit the current tiddler
* ''fields'' - show the custom fields attached to the current tiddler
* ''syncing'' - shows the server synchronisation status of the current tiddler
* ''jump'' - jump straight to another open tiddler
* ''permalink'' - puts a link direct to the current tiddler into the address bar
* ''references'' - displays all the tiddlers that link to the current tiddler
* ''done'' - save changes to a tiddler being editted
* ''cancel'' - cancel changes to a tiddler being editted
* ''delete'' - delete the current tiddler

The shadow tiddler ToolbarCommands allows these commands to customised and reordered.
