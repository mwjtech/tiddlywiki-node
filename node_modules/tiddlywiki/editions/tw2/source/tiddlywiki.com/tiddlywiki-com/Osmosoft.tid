Osmosoft Limited was founded by JeremyRuston in 2005, and acquired by [[BT|http://btplc.com]] in 2007.

Osmosoft is now a small team within [[BT|http://www.btplc.com/]] that focuses on showing the value of open source working methods. It does this through working with the community on the ongoing development of TiddlyWiki, TiddlyWeb and TiddlySpace, and applying them to solve problems within BT.

See http://www.osmosoft.com/ for more details.
