Changes the browser address bar to a permalink to the current tiddler. It is used with the ToolbarMacro like this:
{{{
<<toolbar permalink>>
}}}

On some browsers, the PermalinkCommand can be unreliable if the tiddler title includes characters that have special meanings in ~URLs (like "+" and "\") or are outside the basic ANSI character set.
