This tiddler contains the commands that produce the buttons contained in the slider above the timeline on the right. 
In ~TiddlySpace they are displayed on the right hand side of the menu bar.
By default it is set to:
{{{
<<closeAll>><<permaview>><<newTiddler>>
}}}

You can edit it to include anything else you want.
