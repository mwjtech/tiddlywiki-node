title: Installing TiddlyWiki on Node.js
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

# Install [[Node.js]] from http://nodejs.org
# Open a command line terminal and type:
#> `npm install -g tiddlywiki`
#> If it fails with an error you may need to re-run the command as an administrator:
#> `npm install -g tiddlywiki` (Windows)
#> `sudo npm install -g tiddlywiki` (Mac/Linux)
# Check TiddlyWiki is installed by typing:
#> `tiddlywiki --version`
# In response, you should see TiddlyWiki report its current version (eg `5.0.4-beta`; you may also see other debugging information reported)
# Try it out:
## `mkdir mywiki` to create a folder for a new wiki
## `cd mywiki` to move into the new folder
## `tiddlywiki --server` to start TiddlyWiki
## Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser
## Try editing and creating tiddlers

The `-g` flag causes TiddlyWiki to be installed globally. Without it, TiddlyWiki will only be available in the directory where you installed it.

A slightly different method for installation is recommended if you plan on forking the source code in order to study it or contribute to it. See [[Working with the TiddlyWiki5 repository]].
