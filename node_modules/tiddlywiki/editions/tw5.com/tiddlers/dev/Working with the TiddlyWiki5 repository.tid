! Setting Up

If you plan on working with the TiddlyWiki5 source code then follow these steps:

# Fork the TiddlyWiki5 GitHub repository from https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5
# Clone a local copy of your fork
# Open a command line terminal and change the current working directory to the root of the repo
# Type `npm link` (Windows) or `sudo npm link` (Mac/Linux) to tell [[npm]] to use this copy of the repo as the globally installed one

After this procedure you can work with TiddlyWiki5 via [[npm]] as though it were installed in the usual way with `npm install -g tiddlywiki`.
