Links are regions of a tiddler that can be clicked to cause navigation to a different tiddler. The navigation behaviour is determined by the current StoryView; the classic TiddlyWiki view displays the story as a linear sequence of tiddlers.

Links are useful for modelling organic relationships between tiddlers, and particularly for expressing the navigational paths between tiddlers.

The TiddlerInfoPanel lists incoming links to a tiddler in the tab ''References''.

TiddlerFilters can include the following FilterOperators that work with links:

* `[links[]]` - returns the titles of the tiddlers that are linked from the currently selected tiddler(s)
* `[backlinks[]]` - returns the titles of the tiddlers that link to the currently selected tiddler(s)

TiddlyWiki5 alters the appearance of tiddler links to convey additional information about the target of the link:

|!Link description |!Link appearance |
|To a tiddler that exists |[[LikeThis|TiddlerLinks]] |
|To a tiddler that doesn't exist |[[LikeThis|ATiddlerThatDoesntExist]] |
|To a shadow tiddler that has not been overridden |[[LikeThis|$:/core/copyright.txt]] |
|To a shadow tiddler that has been overridden by an ordinary tiddler |[[LikeThis|SiteTitle]] |

External links are shown like this: http://tiddlywiki.com/ or [[like this|http://tiddlywiki.com/]].
