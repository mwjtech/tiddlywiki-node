title: Tiddlers

Tiddlers are the smallest unit of information in TiddlyWiki. They can be structured with [[links|TiddlerLinks]] and tags.

Internally, tiddlers are an immutable dictionary of name:value pairs called fields. The only field that is required is the `title` field, but useful tiddlers also have a `text` field, and some or all of the standard fields listed in TiddlerFields.
