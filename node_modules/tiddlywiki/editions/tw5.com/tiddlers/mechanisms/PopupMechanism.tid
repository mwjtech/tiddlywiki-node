The popup mechanism allows blocks of content to be selectively displayed and positioned with respect to an anchor. It has several parts:

* StateTiddlers to record whether a popup is currently displayed or not
* The RevealWidget to selectively display the popup content
* The ButtonWidget to trigger the display of the popup by setting the state tiddler appropriately
