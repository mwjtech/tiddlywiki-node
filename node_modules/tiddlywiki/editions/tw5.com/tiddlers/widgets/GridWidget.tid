title: GridWidget
tags: widget

The video widget is not yet (re)implemented.

```
The grid widget assembles tiddlers into a tabular grid based on their titles. For example:

<$grid prefix="GridDemo" rows=3 cols=3/>

In this case, the following tiddlers will be rendered:

|GridDemo_A_1 |GridDemo_A_2 |GridDemo_A_3 |
|GridDemo_B_1 |GridDemo_B_2 |GridDemo_B_3 |
|GridDemo_C_1 |GridDemo_C_2 |GridDemo_C_3 |

The result is:

<$grid prefix="GridDemo" rows=3 cols=3/>
```
