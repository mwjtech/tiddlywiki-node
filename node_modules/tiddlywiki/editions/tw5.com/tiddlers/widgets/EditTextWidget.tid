! Introduction

The edit text widget provides a user interface in the browser for editing text tiddler fields. The editing element is dynamically bound to the underlying tiddler value: changes to the tiddler are instantly reflected, and any edits are instantly propogated.

By default, the edit text widget generates a `<textarea>` as the HTML editing element when the `text` field is edited, and a `<input type="text">` element otherwise. This behaviour can be overridden with the `tag` and `type` attributes.

! Content and Attributes

The content of the `<$edit-text>` widget is ignored.
