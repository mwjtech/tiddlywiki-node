title: HelloThere
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Welcome to TiddlyWiki, a complete interactive wiki in JavaScript. It can be used as a [[single HTML file in the browser|SingleFileApplication]] or as a powerful [[Node.js application|Node.js]]. It is highly customisable: the entire user interface is itself implemented in hackable WikiText.

This is version <<version>> of TiddlyWiki, a major reboot designed [[for the next 25 years|Future of TiddlyWiki]]. It is currently in beta (see the detailed ReleaseHistory). There is a RoadMap for moving to the full release. It is a great time to [[get involved|Community]] and support the future development of TiddlyWiki.

//TiddlyWiki is a free, open source project that depends on [[your love and support|HelpingTiddlyWiki]] for its survival//.

On this site, unless noted otherwise, "~TiddlyWiki" refers to the new version 5, and "~TiddlyWikiClassic" is used to identify the older version.

The deep internal improvements mean that the new version of TiddlyWiki is not fully compatible with TiddlyWikiClassic. Existing content will need massaging, while plugins and themes will have to be completely rewritten. The upgrade path will get smoother as the new version matures.
