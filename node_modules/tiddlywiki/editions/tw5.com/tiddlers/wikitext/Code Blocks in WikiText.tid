You can  use triple backticks <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code> to mark code blocks:

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;
This will be monospaced
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

The three backticks need to be at the start of the line and immediately followed by a newline, otherwise they won't be interpreted correctly.

Renders as:

```
This will be monospaced
```
