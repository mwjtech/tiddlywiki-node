title: Linking in WikiText
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A key capability of WikiText is the ability to make links to other tiddlers or to external websites. There are several ways of doing this:

* To link to a tiddler by title: `[[Tiddler Title]]`
* To link to a tiddler and specify the text of the link: `[[Displayed Link Title|Tiddler Title]]`
* For tiddler titles that match the CamelCase rules, just typing the title will automatically create a link
* To link to an external website, type the full URL of the site: `http://tiddlywiki.com/` or `[[TW5|http://tiddlywiki.com/]]`

You can suppress a link from being recognised by preceding it with `~`. For example:

<<wikitext-example src:"* ~HelloThere is not a link
* ~http://google.com/ is not a link">>
